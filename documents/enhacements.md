2. if it cannot find a answer in the document, then it should search online for the answers. 
3. Write a script, which goves over these 8 pages, and copies any link on these pages if the hostname is same. For each link on the page :
Store : Page Url , parent page, page title, . - This list should also contain parent 8 pages. 

Once you have master list, you can go over each link, see if that page is visited, and extract text content from the page.
